The world has gone through the cycle of [[Ragnarök]] and has plunged into chaos. This means that a lot of the gods, both Æsir and Vanir have perished and no longer walk the realms. Some however, cling to their remaining life force and can be approached by the player. More on this in the descriptions about gameplay.

In the turmoil of [[Ragnarök]], our necromancer—who has honed their power in [[Helheim]] and studied necromancy—returns to the world to claim the glory they were denied in life. This battle is their one chance to emerge from Helheim’s shadows and carve a place in the legends of the new age, wielding necromantic power to face their enemies. 

The battle is fierce and many lives are spilled in the fields of Vigrid. Our necromancer player survives and heads back down into Hel, with what little strength they have left after the battle has subsided. They return to what they call home in [[Helheim]] and start the next phase of their plan.

As time progresses, we start to notice shattering of the barriers that were keeping the realms apart. This is causing the realms to merge to an extent and the player can use this to their advantage. 

## Goal: Establishing a new pantheon
Players decide which gods rise in the new age by supporting, guiding, or even competing with emerging god-like figures. Each choice would shape the nature of the next pantheon, allowing the player to either bring balance or shift the world toward a specific ideology or vision. In pursuing this goal, players would need to navigate alliances and rivalries with competing gods.
