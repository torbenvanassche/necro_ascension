Yggdrasil is the **World Tree** in Norse mythology, a massive, sacred tree that connects all of existence. Its roots and branches link the **Nine Realms**—the different worlds of gods, humans, giants, and more. It’s not just a physical connection but also a symbol of life, fate, and the balance of the cosmos.

The tree is cared for by [[The Norns]], who water its roots with water from the **Well of Urd** to keep it healthy. It’s also home to various creatures, like the eagle at its top and the serpent [[Nidhogg]] at its roots, each symbolizing aspects of the cosmos.

### What Happens When Yggdrasil is Destroyed?

At **Ragnarök**, the apocalyptic end of the Norse world, Yggdrasil trembles under the chaos of battle, fire, and destruction. Eventually, it is destroyed, which symbolizes the collapse of the current order of the universe.

Without Yggdrasil:

- The connection between the Nine Realms is severed.
- Fate itself unravels, as the [[The Norns]] can no longer weave the threads of destiny.
- The world as it exists ends in fire and destruction.

### What Happens After Ragnarök?

Even though Yggdrasil is destroyed, Norse mythology speaks of renewal. A new tree will grow, and the world will be reborn, creating a fresh start for gods, humans, and all beings. This reflects the idea that destruction is not the end but part of a cycle leading to renewal and hope.

In simple terms, Yggdrasil is like the backbone of the universe. Its destruction at Ragnarök means the end of everything—but also the beginning of something new.
