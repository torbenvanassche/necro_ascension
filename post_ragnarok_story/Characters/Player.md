The player is a necromancer. Covered in woad tattoos they have earned through their endeavors, these tattoos appear over time as they have more contracts with creatures they can then control. 
They keep their [[Amulets]] with summons on their belt. Wearing dark weathered robes and fur lined cloaks. Wielding a [[Staff]] for regular attacks and to channel their powers. That staff is rune-etched to invoke their talisman's power (potentially destroying the talisman in the process).

The character is pale, with eyes that could glow if a spell is being channeled for visual clarity. 
Long hair and a beard to hint towards his Viking roots and stay thematic. In addition to that,
 they carry around a [[Ritual Dagger]]  and [[Satchel]] carrying some components they can use to invoke shamanic magic.
## Origin
The character is bitter about not dying with glory and having been sent to Hel, but decides to bide their time. After a pathetic death, the player’s soul ends up in Helheim where Hel notices their potential for necromancy. Instead of leaving them to wander as a normal soul, she allows them to hone dark powers over death, knowing they could become a powerful ally in the coming [[Ragnarök]].

When [[Ragnarök]] arrives, Hel opens a path back to the mortal realms, where the player joins the fight. Armed with powerful necromancy, they step into the chaos of [[Ragnarök]] to seek the glory they missed in life. Their journey from [[Helheim]] to the battlefield makes them a dark, formidable force, wielding death itself as a weapon.
