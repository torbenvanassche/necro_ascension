a serpent-like dragon that dwells around Lyngvi after leaving Niflheim. It gnaws at the roots of Yggdrasil, threatening its stability, and is often seen as a symbol of destruction and chaos. Nidhogg is also associated with the afterlife, feeding on the corpses of the wicked in Náströnd, the shore of corpses. This fearsome creature plays a pivotal role in the cosmic balance of Norse cosmology, embodying the darker forces of the mythological world.
