After the World Tree is destroyed, the realms are in chaos. [[Ratatoskr]] has survived but is bound to one region, unable to move freely. To restore his freedom, he becomes a shopkeeper, trading in rare relics, knowledge, and seeds of the tree, hoping to rebuild [[Yggdrasil]] and regain his freedom. 
Without the Tree’s pathways, he feels trapped. He hopes to reclaim his freedom once he has aided in restoring the tree to its former glory. By controlling who gets access to powerful artifacts, he hopes to sway events and perhaps win the favor of any new gods that might show themselves.

Ratatoskr feels guilty about [[Nidhogg]] having gnawed through the world tree as his anger kept growing and causing his movement between the realms to be severed. The events of [[Ragnarök]] leave him trapped in Helheim where he meets the player as they make an attempt to atone for their sins.

## Goal: Reseeding the world tree
[[Ratatoskr]] is looking to revive the world tree so that they can travel between the branches of the realms. They are trying to achieve this by acting as a shopkeeper using seeds as currency. While Hel is responsible for him having instigated [[Nidhogg]] and getting things in motion for [[Ragnarök]], he still feels guilty and is going on a journey of redemption.
